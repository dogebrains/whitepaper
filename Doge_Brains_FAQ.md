# **Doge Brains FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions)**

## **üìä General Questions About the Project**

### **What is Doge Brains?**

Doge Brains is an AI-powered analytics platform specializing in the analysis of the memecoin market. We aggregate and analyze data from the blockchain, social media, and trading platforms, providing users with risk metrics, forecasts, and warnings about potential manipulations.

### **Who is the platform for?**

The platform has two tiers:

- **Basic (free)** ‚Äî for beginner traders who need simple risk indicators.
- **Premium** ‚Äî for experienced traders and investors who can interpret complex metrics and use deep analytics to build trading strategies.

### **Is Doge Brains an investment advisor?**

**No.** Doge Brains only provides analytical data and metrics. We do not give investment advice. All trading decisions are made by users independently based on the information provided.

### **Which blockchains does the platform support?**

Currently: Ethereum, BSC (Binance Smart Chain), Solana, Polygon. We plan to expand to Arbitrum, Avalanche, and other networks with an active memecoin market.

## **ü§ñ Questions About Platform Functionality**

### **How quickly does the system detect new tokens?**

The system aims to detect new tokens as quickly as possible after their creation and the addition of liquidity. The detection speed depends on numerous factors: the blockchain used, the current network load, and the volume of data being processed simultaneously.

### **How accurate are the platform's forecasts?**

Our machine learning models are constantly being improved based on historical data and feedback. Accuracy depends on many factors:

- **Data quality and completeness** ‚Äî the more sources available, the higher the accuracy.
- **Market conditions** ‚Äî accuracy may decrease during periods of extreme volatility.
- **Type of analysis** ‚Äî detection of technical patterns is usually more reliable than social analysis.
- **Time horizon** ‚Äî short-term assessments are more accurate than long-term forecasts.

It is important to remember: no system can guarantee the accuracy of forecasts in the memecoin market.

### **What is a Risk Score and how should it be interpreted?**

The Risk Score is an integrated risk assessment from 1 to 10:

- **1-3**: Low risk (relatively safe for the memecoin sector)
- **4-6**: Medium risk (caution is required)
- **7-8**: High risk (significant probability of loss)
- **9-10**: Critical risk (extremely high probability of a scam/rug pull)

### **Can I trade directly through the platform?**

No, Doge Brains is an analytics platform. We do not provide trading functionality. Users can use our data to make decisions on any exchange or DEX.

## **üí° Additional Questions**

### **What is "meme-cyclicity" in analysis?**

It is a pattern of activity characteristic of memecoins: peaks of activity on weekends, surges after influencer tweets, and correlation with payday schedules in different regions.

### **Why does the platform focus specifically on memecoins?**

Memecoins require a specialized approach: traditional technical analysis works poorly here, while social factors play a key role.

### **Can the platform be used to analyze regular cryptocurrencies?**

Technically, yes, but the effectiveness will be lower. Our models are optimized for highly volatile assets with strong influence from social factors.
